Some points to consider:

some of the usual ice breakers for formality sake :p

Now that the main site is done what do they expect to do

why pentaprism and not some other club tech team lol

Maybe some past projects (if any)

what they make of our current site and if they can offer any improvements :p

Finally, any red flags to look out for? It's not like we're gonna reject but still XD
